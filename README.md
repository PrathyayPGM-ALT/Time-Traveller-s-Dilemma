# ⏳ Time Traveller’s Dilemma

A narrative-driven 2D game about inevitability, choice, and failure.

You wake up with fragmented memories.  
Your thoughts are not your own for long.  
Every decision alters the timeline — yet you always lose.

The goal is not to win.  
The goal is to **understand**.

## 🎮 About the Game

**Time Traveller’s Dilemma** is a top-down 2D game built in Python using Pygame, focused on:

- Psychological storytelling  
- Atmospheric cutscenes  
- Player agency without traditional victory  
- Multiple endings shaped by decisions  

The game opens with an internal monologue, followed by a violent interruption and an encounter with a mysterious authority figure who controls timelines.

Every playthrough reveals something different.
